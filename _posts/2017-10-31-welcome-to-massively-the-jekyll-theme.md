## Goals for the Studio

Throughout the year we plan to produce both learning games for local 
community educators and web/mobile applications for community partners.
We will develop  initial pilot ideas through workshops with community
partners, provide guidance to students in Dr. Goadrich's upper-level
software development courses. inally revise and develop course-project
prototypes into fully-functional products with supporting documentation 
and resources.

We will organize two workshops per year, as a way of sourcing potential 
ideas for community-focused projects, and providing a direct service to 
the community. First we will organize game design workshops and
brainstorming sessions with local K12 educators. We will lead a game
exercise so the educators gain first-hand experience with the potentail
an constraints on creating games. We will brainstorm around the core
ideas within their teaching focus and either directly implement these
ideas by the studio, or they will become design seeds for final projects
in Dr. Goadrich's CSCI: 370 Interactive Game Development course to 
eventually be built into fully developed games produced by our studio.

We also plan to initiate an annual workshop at Hendrix for nonprofit 
organizations. This workshop will help these organizations gain first-hand experience 
of how becoming a community partner can benefit both their work and our students. We will 
teach the basics of using free and open-source content management systems for organizational websites so they can take ownerships of thier online presence and potentially reduce their budgets. Next the students will give presentations on past and current community partnership projects in order to help nonprofits understand the what it would be like to start a technology partnership with us. Finally 
there will be a brainstorming session where the students will work with the nonprofits to develop potential ideas for implementation. These projects will either be directly picked up by the studio or stated by students in Dr. Goadrich's CSCI 340: Databases and Web Systems or CSCI 352: Mobile Development
and eventually completed as a studio project.
